# MatLab-Creations
MATLAB coding projects over the past 3 years.
Contains some very cool MATLAB projects that I have done in Ocean Engineering. 

The codes contain Navier Stokes Equations, Bernoulli equations, wave equation, SPM & CEM equations that are necessary to calculate waves speeds, directions, forces, vorticity, forecasting etc.
