# MatLab-Creations
MATLAB coding projects related to ocean engineering.

The codes contain Navier Stokes Equations, Bernoulli equations, wave equations, Froude-Krylov Force, Reynolds Number etc. equations that are necessary to calculate waves speeds, directions, forces, vorticity, forecasting etc. 

**Wave Tool will calculate just about every variable if you input some basic wave characteristics(depth,wave height,period) that are usually found in buoy data plots.

For equations and graphs please refer to the Shore Protection Manual (SPM) or the Coastal Engineering Manual (CEM). Both can be obtained online. 


A few example results from the code:
